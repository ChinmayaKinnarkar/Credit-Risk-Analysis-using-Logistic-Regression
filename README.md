# Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-Logistic-Regression

The data is a kaggle data set(https://www.kaggle.com/upadorprofzs/credit-risk). The data contains client id, income, age, loan amount and whether the client has default probability or not. Income, age and loan amount are considered as inputs while default column is considered as target. A logistic regression model is developed to predict if the customer will default on their loan or not. Since there is a class imbalance, class balncer has been used to ensure accuracy of our predictions.
